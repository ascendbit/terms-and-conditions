It is part of your contract with Company and affects your rights. It contains procedures for MANDATORY BINDING ARBITRATION AND A CLASS ACTION WAIVER.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">12.2.1</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of New York. Any claim, dispute, or controversy (&ldquo;Claim&rdquo;) arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the relationships among the parties hereto shall be resolved by one arbitrator through binding arbitration conducted in accordance with the expedited procedures set forth in the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures (the &ldquo;Rules&rdquo;) as those Rules exist on the effective date of this Agreement, including Rules 16.1 and 16.2 of those Rules. The arbitrator&rsquo;s decision shall be final, binding, and non-appealable. Judgment upon the award may be entered and enforced in any court having jurisdiction. This clause is made pursuant to a transaction involving interstate commerce and shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act. Neither party shall sue the other party other than as provided herein or for enforcement of this clause or of the arbitrator&rsquo;s award; any such suit may be brought only in a Federal District Court or a New York state court located in New York County, New York. The arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or local court, shall have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation, applicability, unconscionability, arbitrability, enforceability, or formation of this Agreement including any claim that all or any part of the Agreement is void or voidable.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">12.2.2</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO GO TO COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY, instead electing that all claims and disputes shall be resolved by arbitration under this Arbitration Agreement. Arbitration procedures are typically more limited, more efficient and less costly than rules applicable in a court and are subject to very limited review by a court. In the event any litigation should arise between you and the Company in any state or federal court in a suit to vacate or enforce an arbitration award or otherwise, YOU AND THE COMPANY WAIVE ALL RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL, instead electing that the dispute be resolved by a judge.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">12.2.3</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;If any part or parts of this Arbitration Agreement are found under the law to be invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, then such specific part or parts shall be of no force and effect and shall be severed and the remainder of the Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">12.2.4</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Notwithstanding the foregoing, either you or the Company may bring an individual action in small claims court.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">12.2.5</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may seek emergency equitable relief before a state or federal court in order to maintain the status quo pending arbitration. A request for interim measures shall not be deemed a waiver of any other rights or obligations under this Arbitration Agreement.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">12.2.6</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Notwithstanding the foregoing, claims of defamation, violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, and infringement or misappropriation of the other party&rsquo;s patent, copyright, trademark or trade secrets shall not be subject to this Arbitration Agreement.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">12.3</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Export.
